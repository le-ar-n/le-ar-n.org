# le-ar-n.org
`le-ar-n.org` is a static website using Jekyll to read content and Github Pages to host the site

## To edit content
**Note: While most of the content can be written as Markdown, there are a few custom styles that must use HTML tags. Fortunately these can be written in-line with the MD**

### About and Get Started
Located in `./index.md`

### Sessions
Located within the `./_sessions/` folder
Each session has its own markdown file. Include the video data in the front matter (the block at the top of the file) and any content below that you want to be rendered as a text reference. Other attributes like the title and link to slides are also in the front matter.
